# Endpoints
## ``GET`` : ``/cardboxes/{id}/download`` :  
   allows to download shared cardboxes located on the server.
   For this purpose replace ``{id}`` with the actual cardbox-id of the desired cardbox. The server will send the data as **JSON string** (see example #1).
   This endpoint should be primarily used by the Android application to get shared sets for offline storage and general usage.

## Example JSON #1
```
{
  "_id": "iqPLZZxkQKeAYEIWBVyDgA==", 
  "content": [
    "ACUTUAL CONTENT OF THE BOX",
    "INDIVIDUAL CARDS"
  ], 
  "name": "Star Wars", 
  "owner": "Count_Dooku", 
  "rating": 170, 
  "tags": [
    "star_wars", 
    "roger_roger"
  ]
}
```

## ``POST`` : ``/add_cardbox`` :  
  allows to upload created cardboxes on the server for sharing.
  The data should be sent as **JSON string** (see example #2) and need to meet the following requirements:
  - the authentification data of the uploading user:
    - a key "username" that matches the name of the existing user account becoming the owner of the cardbox.
    - a key "password" with the password of said account. You can generate an account on the ``/register`` page.
  - the data of the uploaded set:
    - a key "tags" with a list of tags that describe the set for easy exploration
    - a key "content" containing the data of the set (should be a list of cards)
    - a key "name" with the given name of the set. Note, that this is not the set-id, since that will be generated by the server.
  
  This endpoint should be primarily used by the Android App to upload cardboxes for sharing.

## Example JSON #2
```
{
  "username": "Obi_wan_Kenobi", 
  "password": "highground", 
  "tags": [
    "star_wars", 
    "hello_there"
  ], 
  "content": [
    "ACUTUAL CONTENT OF THE BOX",
    "INDIVIDUAL CARDS"
  ], 
  "name": "Star Wars"
}
